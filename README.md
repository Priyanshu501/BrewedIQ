## About The Project

This project is an interactive web dashboard built with Streamlit to analyze sales data from a multi-location coffee shop. It provides a comprehensive, high-level overview of business performance, allowing users to drill down into specific metrics.

The dashboard allows users to filter the entire dataset by **store location** and **date range**. The analysis is then presented across four key areas:
1. **Sales Trends:** Analyzing revenue, transactions, and ticket size over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
2. **Time of Day:** Identifying peak hours and busiest days of the week.
3. **Product Performance:** Highlighting top-selling products and categories.
4. **Store Performance:** Comparing sales, growth, and trends acrooss different store locations.

All visualizations are created using Plotly for a clean, interactive experience.

## Key Features

* **Global Filters:** Filter all dashboard data by one or more **Store Locations** and a specific **Date Range**.

* **KPI Cards:** At-a-glance metrics for **Total Sales**, **Total Transactions**, **Average Quantitiy per Ticket**, and **Average Sale Value**.

* **Tabbed Interface:** Cleanly organized analysis across four distinct categories.

* **Sales Trends Analysis:**
    * View metrics by 'Sales', 'Transactions', or 'Ticket Size'.
    * Change time granularitiy between 'Daily', 'Weekly', and 'Monthly'.
    * Toggle on/off a **moving average** to identify trends.
    * View **period-over-period growth** (e.g., Month-over-Month).

* **Time of Day Analysis:**
    * Bar chart of average performance by **day of the week**.
    * Line chart of average performance by **hour of the day**.
    * **Heatmap** showing product category performance by the hour.

* **Top Products Analysis:**
    * **Pie Chart** of sales/transaction distribution by product category.
    * **Treemap** for distribution by specific product type.
    * **Bar Chart** identifying the Top 5 best-selling products.

* **Store Performance Comparison:**
    * KPI breakdowns for each individual store.
    * **Line Chart** comparing sales trends across all stores.
    * **Pie Chart** showing the percentage of total sales contributed by each store.
    * **Bar Chart** comparing weekly growth rates for each location.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Core Programming language.
* **Streamlit:** For building and deploying the interactive web app.
* **Pandas:** For data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
* **Plotly:** For creating interactive data visualizations.
